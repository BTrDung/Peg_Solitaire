## Introduction
Peg Solitaire is a game that consists of a board with 33 holes arranged in the pattern given in the pictures below. 

At the start, every hole except the center is filled with a peg. The player then starts jumping pegs. Any peg that is jumped over is removed, just as in checkers. 

Vertical and horizontal jumps are allowed, but diagonal jumps are forbidden. The goal is to reach a position where only one peg remains.
